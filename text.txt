Automata Theory is a theoretical branch of computer science It established its roots 
during the 20th Century as mathematicians began developing  both theoretically and literally  machines which 
imitated certain features of man completing calculations more quickly and reliably The word automaton itself 
closely related to the word automation denotes automatic processes carrying out the production of speci c 
processes Simply stated automata theory deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines 
referred to as automata Through automata computer scientists are able to understand 
how machines compute functions and solve problems and more importantly what it means
for a function to be de ned as computable or for a question to be described as decidable
